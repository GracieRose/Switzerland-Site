            One of Switzerland's most known things is the Matterhorn. The Matterhorn is the most famous mountains of Europe.
            It is the 6th highest summit in the Alps, and it's said that by the late 1980's, <br>
            more than 500 people have died trying to ascend it since 1865,  with about 12 deaths per year. 
            Although that number has decreased dramatically now. 
            Disneyland, California even has a ride based off of it called, "Matterhorn Bobsleds".
