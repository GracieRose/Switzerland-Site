            Switzerland is widely known as the "Dreamland for Chocolate Lovers" purely because of its chocolate. 
            Their chocolate is made using only the highest of quality ingredients, <br> like the milk and cocoa. 
            Their most known chocolate companies are Tolberone and Lindt.
            It has a rich texture that you only can get from Switzerland, or Zurich, a better-known city for its chocolate.
