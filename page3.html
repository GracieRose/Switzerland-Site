            Switzerland is surrounded by countless mountains, making it a gorgeous country to be in. <br>
             The mountains invite hiking, skiing, and snowboarding. Hiking in Switzerland is one of its main focus points, 
             because of the views. 
             The hikes can vary from tame ones on ground level, to ones on the very top of the mountains.
